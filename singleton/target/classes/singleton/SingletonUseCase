When you use Logger, you use Singleton pattern for the Logger class. 
In case it is not Singleton, every client will have its own Logger 
object and there will be concurrent access on the Logger instance 
in Multithreaded environment, and multiple clients will create/write 
to the Log file concurrently, this leads to data corruption.
